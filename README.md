# Hope-Speech-Detection
Hope is considered significant for the well-being, recuperation and restoration of human life by health professionals. Hope speech reflects the belief that one can discover pathways to one's desired objectives and become motivated to utilize those pathways. We will be using datasets from Hope Speech Detection for Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion-EACL 2021 containing user-generated comments from the social media platform, YouTube in Tamil and English manually labeled as containing hope speech or not. Given a sentence, the system will classify it into 'Hope speech', 'Not hope speech' and 'Not in intended language'. We built various models and combinations including but not limited to transformers based training models, predefined models and trained them to attain efficient classification.
